# CSS, same Markup Different Look #

> The intention of this project is to demonstrate what can be done with pure css and changing what rules or "profile" is applied to exactly the same set of markup and html5 elements. 

---

** Goal 

By the end of this example my goal is to have 5 different profiles that are entirely unique from one another save for the markup that they share. It should be easily changeable EG: clicking on a #link and be entirely mobile responsive as well

As a cursorary method to showcase frontend CSS3 skills I feel that 5 different "Themes" or "Profiles" will be a good number to start with. If I like how this one turned out I will build something far more complex.

### Rules to code by

1. Each different style for the page needs to have it's own linkable version of itself that has a different link href="differentstyle.css" tag in the header it's not efficient to just use a javascript style css switcher.

2. Your layout should be done as mobile responsive as possible while still being able to look good on the biggest of desktop screens

3. Nothing should be dependent on a click or a hover since we are designing with mobile first in mind

4. Every type of accessibility element that has been added to ensure that every type of person imaginable can access and puruse this site.
